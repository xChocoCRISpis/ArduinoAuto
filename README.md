This is a car camera with Arduino and an interface that connects via an HC-06 module, also it can't connect via a normal COM.
The interface is C# .NET Framework, with a remote control, a motor tester, an automatic mode for that car camera I have on the front of which I use 3 ultrasonic sensors, and a tester of the ultrasonic sensors.
I use the Arduino code in the ArduinoCode folder.
